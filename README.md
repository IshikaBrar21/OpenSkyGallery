# OpenSkyGallery

OpenSkyGallery is a platform for *Sky: The Children of Light* players to upload and share their creative and memorable screenshots with the community. Itâ€™s highly recommended for artists to showcase their artwork and add their social IDs, so other players can connect with them online.
